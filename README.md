# **1. Overview**

This **House Price Prediction App** predicts the price of houses in Alberta, Canada, based on real sales data from 2023. The app uses a **Linear Regression model** and allows users to enter house details such as:
- Town or city of the property.
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
- Total area (in square feet).

> **Note:** This tool is for **educational purposes only** and does not reflect actual real estate market values.

## **2. Features**
- ‚úÖ **User-friendly interface** using Streamlit.
- ‚úÖ Predicts house prices based on user inputs.
- ‚úÖ Uses **Linear Regression** for predictions.
- ‚úÖ **Deployed with Cloudflared**, enabling easy access.

---
## **Step 4: How to Run the App**

Follow these steps to launch and run the app:

1. **Run the Streamlit app** in your terminal with the following command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run house_price_prediction.py

# **3. Technology Stack**
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for building interactive apps.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for Linear Regression.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Cloudflared**: Provides temporary public URL for accessing the app.

# **4. Dataset**

The dataset used contains **3,360 house sales records from Alberta, Canada**, during 2023. It includes:
- **Town or city** of the house.
- **Number of bedrooms** and **bathrooms**.
- **Square footage** of the property.
- **Sale price**.

# **5. How Linear Regression Works**

**Linear Regression** is used to model the relationship between the features (independent variables) and the target price (dependent variable). The model assumes a **linear relationship** between the inputs (e.g., square footage) and the output (price).  

### **Steps in the Model:**
1. **One-hot encoding**: Converting categorical variables (places) into numerical values.
2. **Train-test split**: 80% of data for training, 20% for testing.
3. **Model training**: Fitting the Linear Regression model on the training data to minimize the sum of squared errors.
4. **Prediction**: Given user inputs, the model predicts house prices.
